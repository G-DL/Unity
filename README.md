Test game in Unity

This repository contains a test game I made in Unity, by follwing the tutorial available on https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6 , which I advise to those who want to start learning about the Unity environment.

Citation is required if reusing; you are otherwise free to use or edit the project for any purposes.

The game is built into WebGL, but you can build it for your favourite platform.

You can additionally play it here: https://gabriele123.itch.io/test

Controls are A and D to steer the cube, and there are three levels in total.
