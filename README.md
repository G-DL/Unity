Test games in Unity

# 1) CUBE ATTACK

This repository contains a test game I made in Unity, by follwing the tutorial available on https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6 , which I advise to those who want to start learning about the Unity environment.

Citation is required if reusing; you are otherwise free to use or edit the project for any purposes.

The game is built into WebGL, but you can build it for your favourite platform.

You can additionally play it here: https://gabriele123.itch.io/test

Controls are A and D to steer the cube, and there are three levels in total.

# 2) ESCAPE THE HORROR HOUSE

This is a game created on the basis of JohnLemon's Haunted House, available here: https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner

Press WASD or arrow keys to move. Reach the end of the level to win the game, and don't get spotted by gargoyles or ghosts.
