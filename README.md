Test game in Unity

This repository contains a test game I made in Unity, by follwing the tutorial available on https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6 , which I advised.
Citation is required, you are otherwise free to use or edit it for any purpose.

The game is built into WebGL, but you can build it for your favourite platform.

Controls are A and D to steer the cube.
